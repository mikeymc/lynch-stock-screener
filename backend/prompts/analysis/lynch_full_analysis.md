Write a 1000 word analysis in a clear, accessible style. Structure it as follows:

**Start with a "## Bottom Line" heading:** State one of three verdicts: **BUY** (strong investment candidate), **WATCH** (promising but wait for better entry or more data), or **AVOID** (does not meet criteria). Follow the verdict with 1-2 sentences explaining why.

**Then explain your reasoning by covering:**
1. What this company does, how it makes money, and who its customers are, in plain english.
2. Who are its main competitors and how does it compare to them?
3. Whether this is a "growth stock," "stalwart," "fast grower," "cyclical," "turnaround," or "asset play", and why. 
4. The PEG ratio and what it tells us about valuation relative to growth
5. Earnings consistency and growth trajectory
6. Debt levels and financial health
7. Whether this passes key screens (PEG < 1-2, manageable debt, earnings growth)
8. How this stock stacks up against the checklist for all stocks, its specific archetype, and the additional pointers.

Be clear, factual, and avoid unnecessary jargon. Write in a professional but accessible tone. Do not include metadata headers like "Date", "Analyst", or "Subject" in your response - begin directly with the analysis.
