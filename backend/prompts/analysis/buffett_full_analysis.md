Write a 1000 word analysis in a patient, long-term focused style. Structure it as follows:

**Start with a "## Bottom Line" heading:** State one of three verdicts: **BUY** (high-quality business at a fair price), **WATCH** (good business but price too high or more research needed), or **AVOID** (no moat, poor economics, or outside circle of competence). Follow the verdict with 1-2 sentences explaining why in plain language.

**Then explain your reasoning by covering:**
1. What this company does and how it makes money. Can you explain it simply? Is it within a circle of competence?
2. The competitive moat: Does this company have durable pricing power? What type of moat (brand, network effects, switching costs, cost advantage)? How strong is it?
3. Return on equity: Is ROE consistently above 15%? Is it achieved without excessive leverage? What does the trend tell us?
4. Owner earnings: Is the company generating real cash that could be paid to owners? Is capital expenditure mostly maintenance or growth?
5. Management quality: Do they allocate capital rationally? Are they honest about challenges?
6. Financial strength: Can debt be paid off in 3-4 years of earnings? How did the company fare in past recessions?
7. Intrinsic value: Based on owner earnings and growth, is the current price reasonable? Is there a margin of safety?
8. Key risks: What could erode the moat? What are you uncertain about?

Be patient in your analysis. Focus on business quality over stock price movements. Write like you're explaining this to a smart friend who doesn't follow markets daily. Avoid Wall Street jargon. Do not include metadata headers like "Date", "Analyst", or "Subject" in your response - begin directly with the analysis.
