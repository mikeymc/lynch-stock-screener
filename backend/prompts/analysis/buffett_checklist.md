# Buffett's Investment Principles
These principles are distilled from Warren Buffett's shareholder letters, speeches, and writings over fifty years of investing at Berkshire Hathaway.

## UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS
- Can you explain how the company makes money in one or two sentences? If not, it's outside your circle of competence.
- What would happen to this business if you couldn't look at the stock price for ten years? Would you still want to own it?
- Is this a business you'd want your family to own for a generation?
- Would you be comfortable if the stock market closed for five years?

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE (THE MOAT)
The moat is everything. A business without a moat is just a commodity.

**Brand Moat**
- Does the company have pricing power because of brand recognition?
- Do customers seek out the brand specifically, or is it interchangeable?
- Has the brand maintained its position for decades, not just years?

**Network Effects**
- Does the product become more valuable as more people use it?
- Would it be hard for customers to switch even if they wanted to?
- Examples: payment networks, marketplaces, social platforms.

**Switching Costs**
- How painful is it for customers to switch to a competitor?
- Are there contractual, technical, or training barriers?
- Enterprise software and mission-critical systems often have high switching costs.

**Cost Advantages**
- Can the company produce at lower cost than competitors?
- Is the cost advantage structural (scale, location, process) or temporary?
- Can competitors replicate the cost structure?

**Regulatory Moat**
- Does regulation limit competition in this industry?
- Are there licenses, patents, or approvals that protect the business?
- Be careful: regulatory moats can disappear with political changes.

## RETURN ON EQUITY
- Has ROE been consistently above 15% for at least 10 years? Ideally 20%+.
- Is high ROE achieved without excessive leverage? Check debt-to-equity.
- Compare ROE to industry peers. Great businesses stand out.
- Beware of one-time gains inflating ROE. Look at the trend.

## OWNER EARNINGS
Accounting earnings can deceive. Owner earnings reveal the truth.

- Owner Earnings = Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization - Maintenance CapEx
- Is the company generating real cash that could be paid out to owners?
- Are capital expenditures mostly for maintenance or for growth?
- Has owner earnings grown consistently over time?

## MANAGEMENT QUALITY
- Does management allocate capital rationally? Check their track record on acquisitions.
- Do they buy back shares when cheap and avoid buybacks when expensive?
- Are they honest about problems in the annual letter? Or do they make excuses?
- Do executives have significant personal ownership in the company?
- Is executive compensation reasonable relative to performance?

## DEBT AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH
- Can the company pay off all long-term debt within 3-4 years of current earnings?
- How did the company perform in the last recession?
- Is there enough cash and credit to survive a prolonged downturn?
- A company with no debt cannot go bankrupt.

## INTRINSIC VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY
- What is the present value of all future cash flows the business will generate?
- Are you paying a price that provides a margin of safety if your estimates are wrong?
- Great businesses at fair prices beat mediocre businesses at cheap prices.
- If you can't estimate intrinsic value, you're speculating, not investing.

## THINGS TO AVOID
- Businesses you don't understand, no matter how promising they sound.
- Companies dependent on one product, one customer, or one genius.
- Industries undergoing rapid technological change (the moat can evaporate).
- High-debt companies in cyclical industries.
- Management that talks about EBITDA excessively (depreciation is real).
- Companies that grow by acquisition rather than organic growth.
- Any business where the product is a commodity without differentiation.

## PATIENCE AND DISCIPLINE
- It's far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price.
- The stock market is designed to transfer money from the active to the patient.
- Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.
- You don't have to swing at every pitch. Wait for your pitch.
- Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.
- In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine.
