# The Final Checklist
All of this research I’ve been talking about takes a couple of hours, at most, for each stock. The more you know the better, but it isn’t imperative that you call the company. Nor do you have to study the annual report with the concentration of a Dead Sea scroll scholar. Some of the famous numbers apply only to specific categories of stocks and otherwise can be ignored altogether.

What follows is a summary of the things you’d like to learn about stocks in each of the six categories:

## STOCKS IN GENERAL
- The p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.
- The percentage of institutional ownership. The lower the better.
- Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.
- The record of earnings growth to date and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent. (The only category where earnings may not be important is in the asset play.)
- Whether the company has a strong balance sheet or a weak balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio) and how it’s rated for financial strength.
- The cash position. That’s the floor on the stock.

## ARCHETYPES

**SLOW GROWERS**
- Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?) you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid, and whether they are routinely raised.
- When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times. It can earn less money and still retain the dividend. If it’s a high percentage, then the dividend is riskier.

**STALWARTS**
- These are big companies that aren’t likely to go out of business. The key issue is price, and the p/e ratio will tell you whether you are paying too much.
- Check for possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings in the future.
- Check the company’s long-term growth rate, and whether it has kept up the same momentum in recent years.
- If you plan to hold the stock forever, see how the company has fared during previous recessions and market drops. 

**CYCLICALS**
- Keep a close watch on inventories, and the supply-demand relationship. Watch for new entrants into the market, which is usually a dangerous development.
- Anticipate a shrinking p/e multiple over time as business recovers and investors look ahead to the end of the cycle, when peak earnings are achieved.
- If you know your cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the cycles.

**FAST GROWERS**
- Investigate whether the product that’s supposed to enrich the company is a major part of the company’s business. It was with L’eggs, but not with Lexan.
- What the growth rate in earnings has been in recent years. (My favorites are the ones in the 20 to 25 percent range. I’m wary of companies that seem to be growing faster than 25 percent. Those 50 percenters usually are found in hot industries, and you know what that means.)
- That the company has duplicated its successes in more than one city or town, to prove that expansion will work.
- That the company still has room to grow. When I first visited Pic ’N’ Save, they were established in southern California and were just beginning to talk about expanding into northern California. There were forty-nine other states to go. Sears, on the other hand, is everywhere.
- Whether the stock is selling at a p/e ratio at or near the growth rate.
- Whether the expansion is speeding up (three new motels last year and five new motels this year) or slowing down (five last year and three this year).
- That few institutions own the stock and only a handful of analysts have ever heard of it. With fast growers on the rise this is a big plus.

**TURNAROUNDS**
- Most important, can the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash does the company have? How much debt?
- What is the debt structure, and how long can it operate in the red while working out its problems without going bankrupt?
- If it’s bankrupt already, then what’s left for the shareholders?
- How is the company supposed to be turning around? Has it rid itself of unprofitable divisions?
- Is business coming back?
- Are costs being cut? If so, what will the effect be?

**ASSET PLAYS**
- What’s the value of the assets? Are there any hidden assets?
- How much debt is there to detract from these assets? (Creditors are first in line.)
- Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?
- Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholders reap the benefits of the assets?

## SOME POINTERS
- Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific reasons for holding the stock. (It is really going up!” doesn’t count.)
- By putting your stocks into categories you’ll have a better idea of what to expect from them.
- Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves.
- Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a specific product.
- Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.
- Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a year.
- Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.
- Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be diworseifications.
- Long shots almost never pay off.
- It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.
- People get incredibly valuable fundamental information from their jobs that may not reach the professionals for months or even years.
- Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very smart, very rich, and his or her last tip went up.
- Some stock tips, especially from an expert in the field, may turn out to be quite valuable. However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, and people in the health care field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.
- Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.
- Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.
- Look for companies with niches.
- When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.
- Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.
- Managerial ability may be important, but it’s quite difficult to assess. Base your purchases on the company’s prospects, not on the president’s resume or speaking ability.
- A lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.
- Carefully consider the price-earnings ratio. If the stock is grossly overpriced, even if everything else goes right, you won’t make any money.
- Find a story line to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s progress.
- Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.
- Study the dividend record of a company over the years and also how its earnings have fared in past recessions.
- Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.
- All else being equal, favor companies in which management has a significant personal investment over companies run by people that benefit only from their salaries.
- Insider buying is a positive sign, especially when several individuals are buying at once.
- Devote at least an hour a week to investment research. Adding up your dividends and figuring out your gains and losses doesn’t count.
- Be patient. Watched stock never boils.
- Buying stocks based on stated book value alone is dangerous and illusory. It’s real value that counts.
- When in doubt, tune in later.
- Invest at least as much time and effort in choosing a new stock as you would in choosing a new refrigerator.
